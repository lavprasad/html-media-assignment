 Relative Positioning   
- Positioned relative to its original spot.  
- The space it occupies remains reserved.  
- Moved using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`.  
- Common use: Slightly adjust position without affecting layout.  

Example:  
The element moves 10px down and 20px right from its normal spot:  
{position: relative;
top: 10px;
left: 20px;}


 Absolute Positioning   
- Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (or body if none exists).  
- Removed from the document flow (doesn’t leave space).  
- Common use: Precise placement, usually over other elements.  

Example:  
The element is positioned relative to its parent (10px down and 20px right):  
{position: absolute;
top: 10px;
left: 20px;}


Main Difference: Relative retains space in layout; absolute doesn’t.
